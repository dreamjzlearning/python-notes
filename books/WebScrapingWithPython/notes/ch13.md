## 1. Submitting a Basic Form

```python
# 13.1.py
# Submitting a Basic Form

import requests


url = "https://pythonscraping.com/pages/files/processing.php"
params = {"firstname": "A", "lastname": "B"}

r = requests.post(url, data=params)

print(r.text)

```

## 2. Radio Buttons, Checkboxes and Other Inputs

There are only two things to be worried about: the name and value of the element.

## 3. Submitting Files and Images

```python
# 13.2.py
# Uploading Files

import requests

files = {"uploadFile": open("test.txt", "r")}

r = requests.post("http://pythonscraping.com/pages/files/processing2.php", files=files)

print(r.text)

```
