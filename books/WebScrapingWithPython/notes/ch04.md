## 1. Connecting

```python
"""
04.1.py
get html from server
"""

from urllib.request import urlopen

html = urlopen("http://www.pythonscraping.com/pages/page1.html")
print(html.read())

```

## 2. BeautifulSoup

### 2.1 Installing with Virtual Environments

You can install a Python virtual environment to keep everything separated and easy to manage if you intend to work on multiple Python projects.

```sh
# creat a new virtual enviroment
$ virtualenv scrapingEnv 

# activate
# linux
$ source scrapingEnv/bin/activate
# windows
$ scrapingEnv\Scripts\activate

# After the virtual env has been activated
# the env name will be shown in command-line prompt
# then use pip to install bs4
(scrapingEnv)$ pip install bs4
```

### 2.2 Running

```python
"""
04.2.py
Running BeautifulSoup
"""

from urllib.request import urlopen
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html = urlopen("http://www.pythonscraping.com/pages/page1.html")
bs = BeautifulSoup(html.read(), "html.parser")

print(bs.h1)

```

- `BeautifulSoup(html.read(), "html.parser")`: 
  - `html.read()`: HTML string that the object is based on.
  - `html.parser`: parser for html

### 2.3 Connecting Reliably and Handling Exceptions

```python
"""
04.3.py
connect reliably and handling exception
"""

from urllib.request import urlopen
from urllib.error import HTTPError, URLError

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup


def getTitle(url):
    try:
        html = urlopen(url)
    except HTTPError as e:
        return None

    try:
        # if html is NONE, throw AttributeError
        bs = BeautifulSoup(html.read(), "html.parser")
        # if tag is NONE AttributeError
        title = bs.body.h1
    except AttributeError as e:
        return None

    return title


url = "http://www.pythonscraping.com/pages/page1.html"
title = getTitle(url)
if title == None:
    print("Title could not be found")
else:
    print(title)

```
